My first paper in collaboration with [Dirk Helbing](https://coss.ethz.ch/people/helbing.html). You can find it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09254).

***

This paper studies **how social structure can promote or hinder socio-diversity**, employing models of behavioral dynamics and numerical simulations. 

We ran massive simulations of social influence models with networks of up to 100,000 agents and found that **degree-heterogeneity obstructs diversity, while clustering and distance favor it**. 

We introduce a new measure of diversity, the **structural diversity index**, based on how random walks. Code to compute this index can be installed from PyPi ([instructions](https://github.com/ethz-coss/Structural-diversity-index))
