# Literature review
Neffke shows that complementarity is the key driver of city productivity <d-cite key="neffke2019value"></d-cite>.
As knowledge becomes more decentralized it needs to be distributed and this gives rise to the necessity for complementarity.
Jane Jacobs argues that diversity generates complementarities that boost productivity <d-cite key="jacobs1961death"></d-cite>.
So, the chain is Diversity => Complementarity => Productivity. 
Spatial sorting also jumps in, because depending on the form of complementarities, some kind of spatial sorting should 
occur instead of some other. 
Moro shows that embededdnes, the degree in the occupation proximity graphs, is highly related with the resilience of jobs.
This is because the more embedded an occupation is, the more it is able to adapt to shocks <d-cite key="moro2019resilience"></d-cite>.
A similar message comes out of the results of Maria del Rio Chanona. 

What distance between the skills and tasks of two jobs is optimal for their complementarity?
Are complementary jobs near or far from each other? Along which dimensions?
