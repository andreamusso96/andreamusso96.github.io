  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={To any k-dimensional subspace of ℚn one can naturally associate a point in the Grassmannian Grn,k(ℝ) and two shapes of lattices of rank k and n−k respectively. These lattices originate by intersecting the k-dimensional subspace with the lattice ℤn. Using unipotent dynamics we prove simultaneous equidistribution of all of these objects under a congruence conditions when (k,n)≠(2,4).},

  title={How networks shape diversity for better or worse},
  author={Musso, Andrea and Helbing, Dirk},
  abstract={Socio-diversity, the variety of human opinions, ideas, behaviors and
styles, has profound implications for social systems. While it fuels innovation, productivity, and collective intelligence, it can also complicate
communication and erode trust. So what mechanisms can influence it?
This paper studies how fundamental characteristics of social networks
can support or hinder socio-diversity. It employs models of cultural
evolution, mathematical analysis, and numerical simulations. We find
that pronounced inequalities in the distribution of connections obstruct
socio-diversity. In contrast, the prevalence of close-knit communities, a
scarcity of long-range connections, and a significant tie density tend
to promote it. These results open new perspectives for understanding how to change social networks to sustain more socio-diversity and,
thereby, societal innovation, collective intelligence, and productivity.},
