# bio
I am a PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://coss.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Dirk Helbing](https://coss.ethz.ch/people/helbing.html).
Not so long ago, I obtained a Masters in Mathematics at ETH Zurich, and before that I completed a Bachelors at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

# research
My research focus is on leveraging large datasets and network science techniques to understand key economic phenomena. 
Why are certain cities large and others small? What determines firm location choices? What characterizes highly adaptive teams? Why is the middle class hollowing? Why do people vote radical parties? These are the questions that animate my research.
