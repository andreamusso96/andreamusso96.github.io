# bio
I am a PhD student at [ETH Zurich](https://coss.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Dirk Helbing](https://coss.ethz.ch/people/helbing.html).
Not so long ago, I obtained a Masters in Mathematics at ETH Zurich, and before that I completed a Bachelors at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

# research
I am interested in cities as coordination mechanisms for economic growth. 
In particular, I am interested in how complementarities among workers in cities generate agglomeration economies and how diffusion of innovation affects the spatial distribution of economic activity.

I apply tools from network science, computational social science and economics to study these questions.
